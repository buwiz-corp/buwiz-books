## 1. Decisions made

### 1.1 Owner decisions (binding)

Source: [decisions.md](../research/traces/decisions.md), "Owner decisions (binding)", dated 2026-10-29.

| ID | Decision | Effect in these docs |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | Books is a separate service in its own repo (`github.com/buwiz-app/books`, moved from `buwiz-corp/buwiz-books` on 2026-10-31; local clone `/Volumes/goldcoders/mini-apps/books`). It owns business profiles, the ledger, categories, and the Books-to-Forms bridge. buwiz-cloud is used only for sign-in and to confirm which approved tax profiles the user owns. | ADR 0001. [01 section 4.5](01-architecture.md#45-cross-plugin-reach). |
| O2 | The ledger is local-first: encrypted local storage inside the Books mini app's own MCP process, the same pattern as BIR's SQLCipher database. Cloud sync is a later, separate step. | ADR 0002. [01 section 6](01-architecture.md#6-data-ownership-and-local-first-store). |
| O3 | Bookkeeping is universal (business profile). PH tax compliance (tax profile, TIN, COR, BIR forms) is a separate, optional, country-scoped layer that a business profile links to. | [01 section 0](01-architecture.md#0-summary), section 10. |
| O4 | The new repo holds the research and details needed to build the mini app. The TypeScript Books repo at `/Volumes/goldcoders/OSS/buwiz-books` is a reference for domain logic, not the runtime backend. | ADR 0005. [05 section 1](05-implementation-plan.md#1-principles). |
| O5 | Do not deploy, alter real financial data, or file returns. The first slice stops at a reviewable draft. | [04 section 1](04-first-slice.md#1-goal). Slice B stops at a draft. |
| O6 | (2026-10-29, scope correction) Books is bookkeeping and accounting: it records transactions, payroll facts and evidence and produces accounting measures with lineage. The bridge maps measures onto Forms input boxes only, reading taxpayer choices from Forms. Buwiz Forms / the BIR mini app owns elections, applicability, ATC selection, rates, tax due, thresholds, OSD, graduated tax, tax rounding, penalties, due dates and overdue status. | [ADR 0007](adr/0007-books-supplies-measures-forms-owns-compliance.md). Section 2.2. Source: [decisions.md](../research/traces/decisions.md) addendum 2026-10-29. |
| O7 | (2026-10-29, decides D4) Every business profile has an accounting basis, cash or accrual. **The default is cash**, "as that is the simplest". A cash-basis book posts income when money is received and expenses when they are paid, and refuses trade receivable and payable lines. Measures read the entry date; every proposal records the basis. `period_override` is removed. | [ADR 0008](adr/0008-cash-basis-by-default.md). PoC: `poc/src/load.ts` `checkCashBasis`; `poc/test/accounting-basis.test.ts`. Source: [decisions.md](../research/traces/decisions.md) addendum "Owner decisions D4 and D9". |
| O8 | (2026-10-29, decides D9) Books is signed with the existing Goldcoders publisher key `gc-2026-01` at release. The owner is the only Goldcoders publisher. Books is first-party, so its inline cards mount without a click and stay counts-and-status only (D22, RK-21). Tests and stage A sign with a throwaway key under a test key id. | [01 section 5.3](01-architecture.md#53-identity-and-secret-table-proposal-unless-marked); [05 P0](05-implementation-plan.md#p0-plumbing-s); [06 section 13](06-testing-plan.md). Source: as O7. |

### 1.2 Peer contracts (binding)

Sources: [decisions.md](../research/traces/decisions.md), "From the rox session" and "From the buwiz-cloud session", both dated 2026-10-29.

| ID | Peer | Contract | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| P-R1 | Rox | Protocol v1 only. Tickets never raw IDs. Attachments `@short:scope:value`. Money as text. Signed calls carry safe integers only. `args_json` for JSON args. `rox.fit` for cards. Same-plugin opens do not prompt. `rox.storage` 1 MB per app. Routines declare reads and writes. No Keychain in rebuilt binaries (env key file and `*_NO_KEYCHAIN=1`). The agent submits only with a send grant. TINs resolve locally. | [01 section 4](01-architecture.md#4-rox-plugin-manifest-sketch), section 6.2. |
| P-R2 | Rox | A new plugin must be added to the broker's `approved_plugins` trust list. That is a Rox-side change. | `server/src/v1/trust.json:11-23` [V]. [05 P0](05-implementation-plan.md#p0-plumbing-s). |
| P-C1 | buwiz-cloud | v1 has one account and no organizations or workspaces. Do not contradict. | [01 section 10.3](01-architecture.md#103-consistency-with-buwiz-cloud-v1-no-organizations). |
| P-C2 | buwiz-cloud | A tax profile is a TIN: 9-digit root and 5-digit branch. Active only after claim, Form 2303, ID and manual review. | [01 section 5.1](01-architecture.md#51-observed-identity-facts). |
| P-C3 | buwiz-cloud | `GET /api/tax-profiles` for a `books`-scope token returns `{"profiles":[...]}` with `{id, tin_masked, registered_name, activated_at, permissions:["profile.view"]}` per profile and no `tin` field. `id` is a stable opaque UUID, never reused. Approved means non-empty `permissions`. (Superseded the earlier `display` wording on 2026-10-29; the cloud session's buwiz-server PR #4 (head `42190a5`, merged 2026-10-29 07:01 UTC).) | Contract. B1 closed. |
| P-C4 | buwiz-cloud | Device-code sign-in as client `buwiz-books`, scope `books`: `POST /oauth/device/code`, then poll `POST /oauth/token` (aliases `/auth/device/start` and `/auth/device/poll`, `src/web.rs:37-40` [V] at a18c106). Refresh rotates, and reusing an old refresh token revokes the whole grant, so Books must persist the new token before it uses it. `/me`. | `src/oauth.rs:21` [V]. Confirmed by the cloud session reply, 2026-10-29. |
| P-C8 | buwiz-cloud | The v1 contract for Books is sign-in plus `GET /api/tax-profiles`, nothing more; nothing else for Books is on the cloud's v1 plan. Ignore unknown profile fields (more non-sensitive fields may be added, such as `activated_at` in unix seconds). Stable before v1: `id` (opaque UUID per approved claim), the `tin_masked` format, no `tin` for `books` tokens, `permissions:["profile.view"]`. A withdrawn claim drops its profile from the list. Sync comes to the cloud session first. | Cloud session reply, 2026-10-29. [01 section 5.7](01-architecture.md#57-cloud-link-p5-proposal). |
| P-C5 | buwiz-cloud | Books links a business to a tax profile by the opaque `id`, never by TIN. | [ADR 0003](adr/0003-tax-profile-link-by-opaque-id.md). |
| P-C6 | buwiz-cloud | Accountant-for-client delegation is not in v1. | [01 section 10.2](01-architecture.md#102-accountants-for-clients-d15). |
| P-C7 | buwiz-cloud | Rox `tkt_` tickets are plugin-local capabilities. Nothing on the server maps them. | [01 section 5.4](01-architecture.md#54-ticket-rules-proposal). |

### 1.3 Design decisions (W3 write-up, 2026-10-29)

These follow the canonical design's final decisions, numbered as in that design. Each is a PROPOSAL until the owner accepts it. Where the owner has already decided, the row says so.

**Superseded by ADR-0007 (2026-10-29).** Rows marked "Superseded by ADR-0007" below describe tax computation in Books and no longer hold ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-books-supplies-measures-forms-owns-compliance.md)). They are kept as history. DD-27 to DD-29 are the replacements.

| DD | Decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| DD-1 | Books is a separate Rox plugin `dev.goldcoders.books` (owner O1 covers the service; the plugin split is the design's choice) | [ADR 0001](adr/0001-separate-books-plugin.md) |
| DD-2 | Ledger is local-first in the Books MCP process, encrypted, with a key file | [ADR 0002](adr/0002-local-first-ledger.md) |
| DD-3 | Books stores no TIN in any phase. Cloud link by opaque `id`. | [ADR 0003](adr/0003-tax-profile-link-by-opaque-id.md) |
| DD-4 | TIN, profile, draft and validation state stay in BIR. Books reaches them only through the model with BIR tickets. | [01 section 4.5](01-architecture.md#45-cross-plugin-reach) |
| DD-5 | Money is integer centavos. Rates are basis points. JSON carries two-decimal text. No floats in Books. | [01 section 6.4](01-architecture.md#64-money-and-time). **Superseded by ADR-0007 in part:** Books holds no rates; money stays integer centavos and decimal text. |
| DD-6 | PT = round half away from zero of (base centavos × rate bps ÷ 10000), once, at output | **Superseded by ADR-0007.** Tax rounding is Forms' (handed over with D7). |
| DD-7 | Tax meaning is an explicit line attribute. An account never implies a form field. | [ADR 0006](adr/0006-tax-meaning-on-lines-not-accounts.md). **Superseded by ADR-0007 in part:** lines carry accounting and evidence facts, not tax treatment; an account still never implies a form field. |
| DD-8 | Rules are versioned, effective-dated, bound to a pinned Forms schema SHA-256. Proposals store rule set id, schema hash, rate row ids and inputs hash. | [01 section 7.3-7.4](01-architecture.md#73-mapping-schema-proposal). **Superseded by ADR-0007 in part:** no rate row ids; proposals store the rule set, the measures catalogue, the Forms context read and the inputs hash. |
| DD-9 | PT rate rows: 1% for 2020-07-01 to 2023-06-30; 3% otherwise. The reported 1% extension to 2025-12-31 is stored disputed and off, and Books warns. | **Superseded by ADR-0007.** Rates are Forms'. Reference: [rates-reference.v1.json](../research/handoff-to-forms/rates-reference.v1.json). |
| DD-10 | VAT gate: posted sales year-to-date strictly above ₱3,000,000.00 (300000000 centavos). The threshold is a dated fact, not a constant. | **Superseded by ADR-0007.** Thresholds are Forms'. See [compliance-notes.md](../research/handoff-to-forms/compliance-notes.md) §3. |
| DD-11 | Hand-off v1 is model-mediated: `bir_form_fill` with `source: "document"` (label pending D3). Never `user`, never `from_card`. | [01 section 9.2](01-architecture.md#92-mvp-mechanism-p3-model-mediated-proposal) |
| DD-12 | Hand-off v2 (P8): a Books-signed envelope with its own `books` source, and per-box provenance persisted in BIR | [01 section 9.3](01-architecture.md#93-later-mechanism-p8-proposal); [ADR 0004](adr/0004-forms-bridge.md) |
| DD-13 | Books never sends, submits, files, queues or pays, and never calls `bir_form_send` | [01 section 9.6](01-architecture.md#96-hazards); T-UR-04 |
| DD-14 | In an 8%-election year, Books produces no 2551Q values until D5 is decided, and emits no NIL PT010 row in MVP | **Superseded by ADR-0007.** Books produces its measures whatever the election; whether a 2551Q is required is Forms' (D5, section 2.2). |
| DD-15 | A void in an open period posts a reversal dated like the original entry. A reversal in a later period is a return event that blocks until acknowledged. | [01 section 7.6](01-architecture.md#76-void-rule-proposal-open-question-q-1); Q-1 |
| DD-16 | Locks are per tax period, not the org-wide `closedThrough`. Closed entries are immutable. Reopen needs a reason, writes `period_event`, and marks proposals stale. | T-PER-01 to T-PER-08 |
| DD-17 | Every write takes `client_request_id`. A repeat returns the stored result. | [06 section 6](06-testing-plan.md#6-idempotency-and-retry-tests) |
| DD-18 | Certificates count only with status `received`. Period fields are DATE. One certificate feeds one form. A 2306 (WB084, final) never counts in a 2307 measure. | T-P4-01 to T-P4-04 |
| DD-19 | Cloud contract: Books reads `id`, `tin_masked`, `registered_name` and `permissions`, and ignores other fields (P-C8). Non-empty `permissions` means approved. Books refuses any response with a `tin` field or other TIN-shaped fields, and never relies on `filing.submit` (a `books` token gets only `profile.view`). | [01 section 5.7](01-architecture.md#57-cloud-link-p5-proposal); B1 |
| DD-20 | The assistant may create drafts. Posting, voiding, closing, reopening, fact acknowledgement and hand-off confirmation are app-only, behind a user click. | [01 section 5.5](01-architecture.md#55-who-may-do-what) |
| DD-21 | Titles and cards carry no amounts, TINs or legal names by default | [01 section 5.3](01-architecture.md#53-identity-and-secret-table-proposal-unless-marked); T-PRIV-02 |
| DD-22 | Inline cards show counts and status only, until the owner accepts more | [01 section 5.6](01-architecture.md#56-consent-points) |
| DD-23 | Trust path: stage A runs under a per-run trust file. The packaged entry ships only after A0 to A15 and B0 to B8 pass. | [05 section 2](05-implementation-plan.md#2-phase-summary) release gate; D21 |
| DD-24 | Rox signing and conformance tools are Node. The Books repo is Rust. The Bun rule belongs to BK-TS. | [05 P0](05-implementation-plan.md#p0-plumbing-s); D17 |
| DD-25 | Slice B runs only against a scratch BIR profile. No test opens the live BIR database. | [04 section 5](04-first-slice.md#5-setup); B0 |
| DD-26 | BK-TS is a reference only. No import, no change, and its defects are not ported. | [ADR 0005](adr/0005-stack.md); [05 section 1](05-implementation-plan.md#1-principles) |
| DD-27 | Books produces accounting measures per business profile per period, with lineage ([data/measures.v1.json](../data/measures.v1.json)). The bridge maps measures to Forms input keys only, in versioned rule sets r2 ([data/rules/](../data/rules/)). | [ADR 0007](adr/0007-books-supplies-measures-forms-owns-compliance.md); [01 section 7](01-architecture.md#7-accounting-measures-the-bridge-and-proposals) |
| DD-28 | Where a form has alternative input boxes for a taxpayer choice, the bridge reads the choice from the Forms draft (`form_context`, for example 1701-MS `/taxpayer/tax_option`) and never decides, infers or defaults it. A missing or unsupported value blocks. A change makes the proposal stale. | [ADR 0007](adr/0007-books-supplies-measures-forms-owns-compliance.md); `BRIDGE.FORM_CONTEXT_READ_ONLY` |
| DD-29 | 1601-C item 17 (non-taxable 13th month and other benefits, annual ₱90,000 cap per employee) is kept in the mapping layer, labelled "the one input-level tax rule in the bridge", open for the Forms owner. | `data/rules/1601c-v2018.rules.json` `1601C.II.17`; section 2.2 |

## 2. Open owner decisions

Each entry gives the options, the recommendation, and what it blocks. The default is the recommendation.

| ID | Decision | Options | Recommendation | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Titles: neutral label or business name | (a) neutral label; (b) business name | (a) neutral label | A2; P1 release |
| D2 | Key custody | (a) key file now; (b) passphrase-wrapped key (Argon2id) with a backup prompt; (c) Keychain | (a) for MVP; (b) before release. Avoid (c), per the Rox constraint. | Release. Also P8 envelope key (see C5). |
| D3 | Hand-off source label | `document`, `ai`, or a new `books` value in P8 | `document`, confirmed by the Forms owner. `books` in P8. | B8 (label). Slice B. |
| D4 | Accounting basis (when income and expenses are recognized) | — | — | **Decided by the owner (O7): cash by default, accrual available ([ADR 0008](adr/0008-cash-basis-by-default.md)).** The tax timing basis and the treatment of returns and non-operating income stay in section 2.2 (ADR 0007). |
| D5 | 2551Q in an 8% year | — | — | **Handed to Forms (ADR-0007).** Section 2.2. |
| D6 | Authoritative source for the 1% extension to 2025-12-31 | — | — | **Handed to Forms (ADR-0007).** Section 2.2. |
| D7 | Rounding of tax amounts | — | — | **Handed to Forms (ADR-0007).** Section 2.2. Books measures are exact centavos and never rounded. |
| D8 | Routine writes for Books | None / some | None | P9 |
| D9 | Publisher key | — | — | **Decided by the owner (O8): reuse `gc-2026-01`.** Counts-only inline cards (D22). |
| D10 | Uninstall: keep or delete data | Keep / delete | Keep | None |
| D11 | Model visibility of lineage and entry references | (a) totals and tickets only; (b) entry references too | (a). Lineage app-only. | P1 tool schemas |
| D12 | Slice B isolation | (a) scratch BIR through a second broker; (b) BIR's own harness | (b) if (a) cannot be shown to be safe (UNKNOWN). See B2. | Slice B on the Rox host |
| D13 | Repo naming: buwiz-cloud local, buwiz-server remote | Keep / rename | Keep. Settle before first release. | Release |
| D14 | Overdue Q3 2026 2551Q (due 2026-10-25) | — | — | **Handed to Forms (ADR-0007).** Due dates, overdue status and penalties are Forms'. Section 2.2. |
| D15 | Accountant access | (a) pass-based; (b) owner-signed delegation | (a). Timeline P9. | P9 |
| D16 | Assistant may create drafts (`books_entry_draft`) | Yes / no | Yes. Posting is app-only. Applied in M1. | P1 |
| D17 | Node tooling in a Rust repo | Exempt Rox tools / no | Exempt Rox signing and conformance tools | P0 |
| D18 | Cloud contract drift (B1) | Per-field decisions | Mostly settled by the cloud session in buwiz-server PR #4 (head `42190a5`, merged 2026-10-29 07:01 UTC): `tin` dropped for `books` and `mcp` tokens; `tin_masked`, `registered_name`, `activated_at` kept; `buwiz-books` gets scope `books` with `profile.view` only. Still open: hash or encrypt stored TINs (`tin_claims.tin_root`, plain 9 digits today; the indexes `tin_claims_one_owner` and `tin_claims_one_open` depend on it). The cloud session recommends an HMAC of root and branch under a server key for the uniqueness indexes, plus the TIN encrypted with AES-GCM like claim documents. A plain hash cannot work, because the BIR app (`app` scope) and reviewers need the full TIN. **Needs the owner's sign-off. It changes nothing Books sees.** (cloud session reply, 2026-10-29) | Cloud only; does not block Books |
| D19 | Sign-in at first run | Required / optional | Optional. Books works offline. | P5 |
| D20 | Sales returns and credit notes in the 2551Q base | — | — | **Now a mapping question for tax review (ADR-0007).** Returns, allowances and discounts are separate measures, and return events still need a person's acknowledgement (bookkeeping review, `GATE.RETURNS_ACK`). Which measure feeds 2551Q `txtATCAmt1` (net or gross sales) is mapping `2551Q.S1.1.base`, `review: open`; the rule set uses `net_sales`. |
| D21 | Trust release timing | Before or after stage A | After A0 to A15 and B0 to B8 pass in stage A | Installed users |
| D22 | Canonical tree for any BIR or Forms change | Live `reverse-engineer-ebir-forms/bir`; buwiz-forms pin; buwiz-oss | Live tree for code. Buwiz-forms pin for schema data only. | P3, P8 |
| D23 | Payor TIN for 2307 matching | Plaintext / HMAC plus masked display | HMAC for matching, masked display only | P4 |

Owner answers given with the build goal (2026-10-29), recorded in [09](09-build-log.md#owner-decisions-applied-given-with-the-build-goal-2026-10-29): void marks the original Voided (Q-1); the first import is web Buwiz Books, then CSV; the owner confirms account matches; a mid-year start uses opening totals with proof; the assistant passes the BIR tax option as `form_context`; inline cards show amounts only on cards the user asked for (amends D22 for answer cards); TMP means templates.

### 2.1 New open questions (raised while writing)

These are not in the canonical design. Each needs an owner's call.

| ID | Question | Options | Recommendation | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q-1 | How does a void affect the tax base? | (1) original becomes `voided`; base skips voided entries and reversal entries; (2) original stays `posted`; reversal is `posted`; base sums both to zero | **Decided by the owner (build goal, 2026-10-29): (1), the original shows Voided.** Built in M1 (`books-store` `entries::void`; [09](09-build-log.md)). | P1 exit. A4 passes under either. [01 section 7.6] |
| Q-2 | Does Books post the PT accrual to the ledger (Dr 94100, Cr 21800)? | (a) no accrual in MVP; (b) post the amount Forms computed, once the user confirms the Forms draft | (a). Under ADR-0007 the amount can only come from Forms; Books never computes it. BK-TS never posts these accounts `[books §3b]`. | P2 exit. Not Slice A. |
| Q-3 | Where does the refresh token live in the Books process? | (a) 0600 file under the data folder; (b) Keychain | (a). Avoid Keychain per the Rox constraint. | P5 |
| Q-4 | What happens when a user types a TIN-shaped number into a label or memo? | (a) refuse with an explanation; (b) warn and store; (c) store and never output | (a). Applied in M1 (`books-core` `privacy::tin_like`; code `tin_refused`). | T-PRIV-06 |
| Q-5 | P6 "per-run keys": what do they protect? | (a) export encryption keys per run; (b) Rox signing keys per run; (c) other | Confirm the meaning. The canonical text does not say. | P6 scope |
| Q-6 | Is `tax_type` one value per line, or a set? | — | — | **Resolved by ADR-0007:** `tax_type` is removed. A sale is one `business_sales` line; the mapping decides which boxes the measure feeds. |
| Q-7 | What covers PT rate rows before 2020-07-01? | — | — | **Handed to Forms (ADR-0007).** Section 2.2. |
| Q-8 | How is a credit note or sales return classified on its line? | (a) explicit line classification (`income_class: contra_sales` plus `contra_kind`: return, allowance or discount); (b) classification from the category default | (a). A `contra_sales` line without `contra_kind` is refused. | P2 exit. Resolved in the PoC. |
| Q-9 | Should cloud agent (`mcp`) tokens be able to read `tin`? | Answered by the cloud session in buwiz-server PR #4 (head `42190a5`, merged 2026-10-29 07:01 UTC): no. `mcp` and `books` tokens get `tin_masked` only; only the `app` scope (`buwiz-desktop`) sees full TINs and can file. | (a), as implemented. | P5 |

### 2.2 Handed to Forms (compliance side)

Moved out of Books by the owner correction of 2026-10-29 ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-books-supplies-measures-forms-owns-compliance.md)). Books no longer decides these. The evidence is kept here and in full in [research/handoff-to-forms/compliance-notes.md](../research/handoff-to-forms/compliance-notes.md).

| Former ID | Question | Evidence (kept) | Owner now |
|---|---|---|---|
| D5 | 2551Q in an 8% year: block, NIL PT010 row, or no 2551Q | RMO 23-2018 pt 9(a)-(e): 8% electors do not file 2551Q `[bir §3.2 8-6; verify §2 item 73]`. buwiz-oss `form_2551q.rs:2202-2228` requires NIL PT010 rows `[verify §2 item 84]`. BK-TS blocks (`deadlines.ts:122`). RR 8-2018 full text not read (HTTP 403). Conflict CONFIRMED; resolution UNCONFIRMED. | Forms |
| D6 | Source for the claimed 1% PT extension to 2025-12-31 | Commentary only; no enacting law `[verify §2 item 63]`. Stored OFF in `rates-reference.v1.json`. | Forms |
| D7 | Rounding of tax amounts | Live cents helper is f64 (`form_2551q.rs:1467`); golden ties 1.50 → 0.05, 1.49 → 0.04, −1.50 → −0.05 at 3% (R-11). | Forms |
| D14 | Overdue status and penalties (Q3 2026 2551Q was due 2026-10-25) | Workbook II.23 "Do not invent penalties"; `[verify §2 item 9]`. | Forms |
| D4 (tax part) | Tax timing basis for 2551Q; returns and non-operating income treatment | `[bir PT-3, PT-8]` | Forms (the book's accounting basis stays with Books: O7, ADR 0008) |
| Q-7 | PT rate rows before 2020-07-01 | No cited row | Forms |
| DD-9, DD-10, DD-14 | Rate rows, VAT gate, 8%-year block | `rates-reference.v1.json`; `compliance-notes.md` §3 | Forms |
| B7 (Forms bug) | 1701-MS items 12 and 17 and `taxCodeDropdown` II015-II017 are not locked against the profile election | `[verify §1 item 3, §2 item 10]` | Forms. Still blocks any 1701-MS fill: the bridge reads `/taxpayer/tax_option` and `/taxpayer/deduction` from the draft. |
| (open) | 1601-C item 17 non-taxable cap (₱90,000 per employee per year): Forms applies it, or the bridge keeps it (DD-29) | NIRC s32(B)(7)(e) as amended; RR 11-2018 s2.78.1(B)(11) `[bir 3.4]` | Forms owner to decide |

## 3. Access blockers

These blocker IDs (B1 to B11) are separate from the Slice B acceptance criteria B0 to B8 in `docs/04` section 8.2. Where a Slice B row says "B3", it means that acceptance criterion.

| ID | Blocker | Phase | Owner | What unblocks it | Status |

## 4. Cross-team asks

### 4.1 Rox owner

1. Trust entry `dev.goldcoders.books` in `server/src/v1/trust.json` under `approved_plugins` (lines 11-23). Release only, after B8.
2. Confirm that a second `rox-broker` (its own `--port` and `--data`) can run with a per-run `ROX_TRUST_FILE`. Confirm whether the Rust launcher forwards that variable to the Node side. [06 section 13]. Addresses RK-2 and B2.
3. Confirm the plugin-side refusal mapping. The broker turns any `isError` into `tool_error` (`server/src/v1/sessions.mjs:300`). The spec may intend `permission_denied` for authorization refusals. [rox §5 stage 7, INFERENCE]
4. Confirm that the short name `books` and the command `books` are free among enabled plugins (RK-24).
5. Confirm that the running broker build matches the perf-parity source. [rox §10, UNKNOWN] (RK-20).

### 4.2 buwiz-cloud session

Status 2026-10-29: items 1, 2, 3 and 6 are addressed by buwiz-server PR #4 ("Only the BIR app sees full TINs and files returns", head `42190a5`, merged 2026-10-29 07:01 UTC). The cloud session reports it verified the fix live with real `buwiz-books` and `buwiz-desktop` device-flow tokens; this repo has read the diff but not run it.

1. ~~Align `GET /api/tax-profiles` with the decisions contract (B1, D18).~~ PR #4: a `books` token gets `{id, tin_masked, registered_name, activated_at, permissions:["profile.view"]}` and no `tin`. A unit test asserts neither the raw nor the dashed TIN appears. The contract keeps `tin_masked` (not `display`), `registered_name` and `activated_at`; Books accepts that.
2. Update the contract row at `README.md:74` to match PR #4.
3. ~~Confirm the `buwiz-books` client.~~ PR #4: device-flow clients get their own scopes (`buwiz-desktop` → `app`, `buwiz-books` → `books`). Before PR #4, `buwiz-books` had scope `app` and could create submissions; `books` and `mcp` tokens now get 403 `insufficient_scope` on `POST /api/submissions` and on the relay.
4. Still open, for the owner: hashing or encryption for `tin_claims.tin_root` (`migrations/0001_init.sql:79`) (D18). The cloud recommendation is in D18.
7. Contract confirmed on 2026-10-29 (P-C4, P-C8): sign-in plus `GET /api/tax-profiles` is all of v1 for Books.
5. Note: `/api/tax-profiles` filters on `status = 'approved'` (`src/claims.rs:418` at 9f5ee16). Books relies on that.
6. ~~Decide Q-9.~~ PR #4: MCP `list_tin_claims` returns `tin_masked` only.

### 4.3 Forms owner

1. Confirm the `document` label semantics for a Books hand-off (D3; R-4, R-19).
2. Add the 1701-MS locks (items 12, 17, II015 to II017) before any 1701-MS fill (B7; `[verify §1 item 3]`).
3. Rounding of tax amounts and the f64 cents helper (former items 3 and 5) are Forms' own decisions now (D7, section 2.2). The tie vectors are in `research/handoff-to-forms/compliance-notes.md`.
4. Confirm the three full digests in [01 section 9.1](01-architecture.md#91-observed-constraints).
5. Decide who applies the 1601-C item 17 cap (DD-29): Forms, or the bridge.
6. Take over the handed items in section 2.2 and [research/handoff-to-forms/](../research/handoff-to-forms/).

### 4.4 BIR owner

1. Confirm the scratch install recipe for Slice B (D12; B2).
2. Gate or remove `bir_form_send` before any live use. Make "allow once" session-scoped. Give standing grants an expiry (RK-13; `[bir-shell §8 item 1]`).
3. P8: add the `books` source and persisted per-box provenance (changes 5, 6, 7 in [01 section 9.4](01-architecture.md#94-changes-needed)).
4. Say whether BIR writes in the background while idle (RK-19).
5. Say whether `bir_form_fields` echoes computed item 14 (B2).
6. Remove the claim path for `source: user` with `from_card` (RK-14; `[bir-shell §8 item 2]`), in a later change.

### 4.5 Tax professional review (through the owner)

Items 1, 2, 4 and 6 (8%-year rules, the 1% extension, Annex C scope, the VAT threshold CPI) and the tax part of item 5 are now Forms' (section 2.2). The Books-side review covers the mapping questions:

1. Net or gross sales for 2551Q Schedule 1 row 1 (former D20; mapping `2551Q.S1.1.base`).
2. 1601-C item 19 statute text (RR 11-2018 is CONFIRMED); the OT, NSD and hazard basis for item 16 (P6).
3. Whether the withheld PT credit goes only to 2551Q item 15 (`[bir W-3]`, INFERENCE).
4. Whether income final-taxed at source is excluded from 1701-MS IV.13 and IV.20 (`EXC.FINAL_TAX_INTEREST`).

## 5. Design corrections

The canonical design is the input to this write-up. This section records every place where the evidence checked on 2026-10-29 disagrees with it, and what these files do about it. The owner and the peers are not asked to re-decide anything here unless a row says so.

## 6. Known gaps in this write-up

- No Books product code exists yet. The PoC suite runs (see `poc/README.md`).
- No live call was made to Rox, BIR or buwiz-cloud.
- The canonical R-1 to R-24 register text is not reproduced (C13).
- Q-1 to Q-9 are open.
- UNKNOWN items: the second broker (B2), `bir_form_fields` echo (C15), BIR background writes (RK-19), BIR audit trail (T-REP-05), whether the Rust launcher forwards `ROX_TRUST_FILE` (06 section 13).
- Resolved (2026-10-29): `fixtures/vectors/money-and-mapping.json` (formerly `money-and-rules.json`) stores `*_centavos` values as integer strings, not JSON numbers, so no consumer parses money into a float. The PoC privacy scanner exempts integer strings under `*_centavos` keys from the TIN check by field context (AGENTS invariant 14), and `poc/test/privacy.test.ts` proves the exemption is narrow. Integer-centavo strings in test vectors are a deliberate exception to the two-decimal display text of invariant 1.
- Records to update: `decisions.md` (B9), and the canonical design's corrections in section 5.
- The PoC maps both 1701-MS pathways from the Forms context (IV.5/IV.6 for graduated, IV.19 for 8%). It computes no tax on either (ADR-0007).
